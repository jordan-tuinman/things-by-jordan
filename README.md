## About

Things by Jordan is my own personal portfolio website, this website (obviously..). It was my first experience working using Gatsby and GraphQL. I decided to build my website using Contentful CMS after having it recommended to me during a chat with another local web developer - cheers Alex! - and I used styled-components to style my site and make it responsive, then hosted on Netlify!

I decided to create this website because I wanted a place to show my development projects to potential employers, and to display bits and pieces of arty things that I create. Additionally, I wanted an easy-to-use CMS that I could use to update my websites content without having to edit the source code – that’s where Contentful came in. I spent quite a lot of time deciding on a design theme that reads my personality and interests; something a bit fun and arty yet not silly.

During development, I found Gatsby to be very easy to learn to use since it’s based on the React framework, and also considering the great documentation available. GraphQL was a similarly easy tool to pick up. I used this to query my data on Contentful, and I created react hooks for some key queries so I could import them into components and pages as necessary without having to repetitively code the same queries. As for using styled-components, it wasn’t something I had a lot of experience with before. I watched a couple of videos on YouTube for some examples on how to create styled components that are responsive, and after that found it a fun process and a valid alternative to the usual CSS files I might use.

I had a lot of fun making this website, and designing something that shows a bit of me and who I am. If you feel like it, drop me a line and let me know any feedback you may have.

Thanks for reading!
